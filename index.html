      <h1 id="first"> My Autobiography</h1>
        <h2 id="second"> Hello there,</h2> <h2 class="brief1"> My name is Keviweto Yhoshu and i am from Nagaland in India.I am 11 years old.I study in Livingstone Foudation International(L.F.I.)</h2><br>
        <h2 class="brief1">So,let's talk about where i live.</h2>
        <h3 class="brief1">I live in  kacharigaon, a village in Dimapur.It is a very nice area in the villages where it is quite exept when cars are around.The houses over here in Kacharigaon is a bit mixed up, in another way, there are many different structures of houses from RCC buildings to wooden kacha houses.There are four khels/blocks in kacharigaon.(as much as I know!)
        They are,Khel 'A',Khel 'B',Khel 'C' and Khel'D'.</h3><br>

        <h2 class="brief2">Now,let's talk about my family.</h2>
        <h3 class="brief2">My small family consists of 6 members, my father,my mother,my siblings and myself. I have 2 smaller brothers(Sito Don(class4 9years)and Diezevi(2years)) and 1 elder sister(Sisano class8 12years).I am going to say this honestly that sometimes they can be a bit annoying and fun to play/discuss some things(except Diezevi),they are ok just to have fun with.But I do not trust them to keep some of my secrets(which i won't be mentioning it to you) except my cousin brother(Teja) (but i do not know his full name) but i dont share all my secrets with him, there are some of my secrets which nobody knows,not even my closest friends.</h3>
        <h3 class="brief2">My large family (from both my father's and mother's side)consists of 50 members(without adding relatives 'cause I dont know 'em).They are all good and some do entertain me. Most of them are mainly serious but sometimes they joke around. My favourite cousin is Kevisale.He actually listens to me most of the time like i am his boss anyway it is normally fine if he is like that.I like to play games with some of my cousins who are good at them and i like to play board games with those who want to play.I also just hang around/talk with some of them if i am bored,whether they are my age,older or younger than me.It just feels right to play together with my whole family.</h3>

        <h2 class="brief3"> Funfact!</h2>
        <h3 class="brief3">My grandfather said that he and his parents hid in the jungle during world war 2 and survived without getting hit by a bullet. They had to run to the jungle because the war hit that particular area which they were living at,at that time. Now in the plot of land of my Great grandfather Vicha, we built a small hotel where guest rented rooms during hornbill festival.Different types of people came to this hotel. As i correctly remember there were different indians from different states,Americans, some Brittish,French,Japanese,people from the Netherlands and people from Isreal.
